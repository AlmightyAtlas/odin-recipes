        <p>Stephen is a husband and father of 5 boys (Christian, Demetri, Uriah, Jaylen and unborn son), 3 can be seen in the image below.</p>
        <p>Stephen's Recipes was inspired by Stephen's desire to build a great first attempt at a website.</p>
        <p>Stephen began the Odin Project in mid-May of 2024, he had never written and code before.</p>
        <p>Stephen quick picked up how to make a basic sight using HTML:5, this is the first-ish site he built.</p>
