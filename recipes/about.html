            <p></p>3 can be seen in the image below. He'll tell you that, his #1 priority is their well being.</p>
        <p>Stephen'sRecipes.com was inspired by Stephen's desire to build a great first attempt at a website.</p>
        <p>Stephen began the Odin Project in mid-May of 2024, he had never written any code before.</p>
        <p>Stephen quickly picked up how to make a basic sight using HTML:5, this is the first-ish site he built.</p>
